# Station-Manager

Station manager is an application made to bring the power back into playlist management. Pairing the Spotify and Last.fm APIs, this application allows the user to assess

Back in college, when having a "system" for listening to music was more of a going concern, I picked up a system from my roommate Zach, who would make an iTunes smart playlist of only songs with fewer than two listens. He'd shuffle the playlist while working or grinding WoW raids, and if a song piqued his interest, he'd give it one star. Same would go for music in regular rotation; if he was going through a Bowie phase or shuffled an old favorite, he'd throw a star rating on it. Then, his one-star smart playlist would serve like a personal radio station: all *his* hits, all day.

Now it's 2018, and iTunes is a very different application. Meanwhile, streaming music brings the world to your fingertips, but without the management; you either have to know what you want to listen to by name, or let the service serve up its own recommendations. It's only an illusion of power; I'm usually paralyzed by the choices and often retreat to old favorites instead of forging forward.
